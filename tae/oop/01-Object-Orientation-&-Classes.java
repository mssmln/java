// In summary, in object oriented programming, each object has three dimensions: identity, attributes, and behavior.
// Attributes describe the object's current state, and what the object is capable of doing is demonstrated through the object's behavior.

// A class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself.
// In other words, classes can be described as blueprints, descriptions, or definitions for an object. You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple objects. The first step is to define the class, which then becomes a blueprint for object creation.

// In other words, an object is an instance of a class.
