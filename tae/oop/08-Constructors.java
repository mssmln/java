// Constructors are special methods invoked when an object is created and are used to initialize them.
// A constructor can be used to provide initial values for object attributes.
// A constructor name must be same as its class name.
// A constructor must have no explicit return type.
// You can think of constructors as methods that will set up your class by default, so you donâ€™t need to repeat the same code every time.
// The constructor is called when you create an object using the new keyword.
// A single class can have multiple constructors with different numbers of parameters.
// The setter methods inside the constructors can be used to set the attribute values.
// Java automatically provides a default constructor, so all classes have a constructor, whether one is specifically defined or not.

// Your friend is a cashier at a movie theater. He knows that you are an awesome java developer so he asked you to help him out and create a program that gets movie title, row, and seat information and prints out a new ticket.
// Complete the existing code by adding a constructor to Ticket class so that it can be correctly initialized.
